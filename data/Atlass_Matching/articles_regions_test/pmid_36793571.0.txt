Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Central Nervous System (CNS)**

2. **Sensorimotor Cortex**
   - Bilateral motor cortex (M1)
   - Ipsilateral secondary somatosensory area

3. **Occipital Cortex**
   - Lingual gyrus

4. **Parietal Cortex**
   - Precuneus
   - Superior parietal lobe

5. **Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)**

6. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Regions associated with executive function and attention

7. **Primary Motor Cortex**

8. **Secondary Somatosensory Cortex**

These regions are involved in various aspects of motor control, sensory processing, and sensorimotor integration, particularly in the context of ACL injury and rehabilitation.
