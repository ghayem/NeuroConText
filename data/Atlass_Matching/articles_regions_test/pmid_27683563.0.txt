Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
   - Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)
     - Rostral Anterior Cingulate Cortex (rACC)
   - Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)

2. **Hippocampus**
   - Left Hippocampus
   - Right Hippocampus

3. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)**

4. **Sensorimotor Cortex**
   - Right Sensorimotor Cortex

5. **Paracentral Lobe**

6. **Presupplementary Motor Area (preSMA)**

7. **Postcentral Gyrus**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:
- **PFC**: Response inhibition, cognitive control, inhibition of fear and non-emotional responses.
- **Hippocampus**: Contextual learning, memory, regulation of inhibitory processes.
- **PCC**: Internally directed cognition, controlling focus of attention.
- **Sensorimotor Cortex, Paracentral Lobe, preSMA, Postcentral Gyrus**: Response inhibition, motor control, and sensory processing.
