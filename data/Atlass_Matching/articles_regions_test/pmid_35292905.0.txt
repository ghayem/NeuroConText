Based on the provided article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned, along with their associated cognitive functions:

1. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)**
   - Involved in: Self-referential processing, internally generated thought processes, emotional and social events, self-directed cognitions, self-awareness, attention to internal/external events, emotional responses.

2. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - Involved in: Self-referential processing, emotional processing.
   - Sub-regions:
     - Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)
     - Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)
     - Angular Gyrus (AG)
     - Hippocampus
     - Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL)

3. **Amygdala**
   - Involved in: Emotional awareness, emotional processing.

4. **Insula**
   - Involved in: Interoceptive awareness, emotional awareness.

5. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)**
   - Involved in: Attentional control, cognitive-behavioral processes.

6. **Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)**
   - Involved in: Emotional regulation, self-referential processing.

7. **Frontocingulate Regions**
   - Involved in: Attentional control.

8. **Precuneus**
   - Involved in: Self-referential processing, emotional processing.

16. **Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)**
    - Involved in: Cognitive control, emotional regulation.

17. **Posterior Insula**
    - Involved in: Interoceptive awareness, emotional processing.

18. **Temporal Pole**
    - Involved in: Socio-emotional processing.

19. **Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG)**
    - Involved in: Cognitive control, working memory.

20. **Brainstem**
