Based on the provided article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)

2. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Broca’s area

3. **Parietal Lobe**
   - Primary somatosensory cortex
   - Supramarginal gyrus

4. **Temporal Lobe**
   - Primary auditory cortex
   - Middle temporal gyrus
   - Superior temporal gyrus

5. **Cingulate Cortex**
   - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)

6. **Basal Ganglia**
   - Basal ganglia (BG) networks

7. **Cerebellum**
   - Cerebellar (CB) networks

8. **Other Cortical Regions**
   - Sensorimotor networks (including motor cortex)
   - Visual networks (including visual cortex)
   - Default-mode networks (DMN)
   - Attentional networks (ATTN)
   - Frontal networks (FRONT)

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including but not limited to:
- **Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)**: Working memory, verbal fluency, and executive functions.
- **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)**: Complex functions such as communication, social behavior, and emotional regulation.
- **Superior temporal gyrus**: Language-related symptoms and processing speed.
- **Supramarginal gyrus**: Processing speed deficits.
- **Primary auditory cortex**: Auditory processing.
- **Middle temporal gyrus**: Language and semantic processing.
- **Primary somatosensory cortex**: Somatosensory processing.
- **Broca’s area**: Language production.

These regions have been connected with functional deficits in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, psychotic bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.
