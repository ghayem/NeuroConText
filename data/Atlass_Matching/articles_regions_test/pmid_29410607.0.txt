Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article, along with their associated functions:

1. **Insular Cortex**
   - Ventral Anterior Insula (vAI)
   - Dorsal Anterior Insula (dAI)
   - Posterior Insula (PI)
   - Middle-Posterior Insula
   - Right Anterior Insula

2. **Orbital Frontal Cortex**

3. **Temporoparietal Junction**

4. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**

5. **Middle Cingulate Cortex (MCC)**

6. **Precentral Gyrus**
   - Left Precentral Gyrus
   - Right Precentral Gyrus

7. **Supplementary Motor Area**

8. **Basal Ganglia**

9. **Sensorimotor Regions**

10. **Occipital Area**

11. **Rolandic Operculum (ROL)**

12. **Default Mode Network**

13. **Central Executive Network**

14. **Salience Network (SN)**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions and processes, including:

- **Insular Cortex**: Emotion processing, sensorimotor processing, self-awareness, interoceptive perception, and integration of multisensory information.
- **Orbital Frontal Cortex**: Decision-making, emotion regulation, and reward processing.
- **Temporoparietal Junction**: Social cognition, theory of mind, and attention reorienting.
- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**: Error detection, conflict monitoring, and emotional regulation.
- **Precentral Gyrus**: Motor function and planning.
- **Basal Ganglia**: Motor control, learning, and reward processing.
- **Sensorimotor Regions**: Sensory and motor processing.
- **Occipital Area**: Visual processing.
- **Rolandic Operculum (ROL)**: Taste processing and somatosensory functions.
- **Default Mode Network**: Self-referential processing and mind-wandering.
- **Central Executive Network**: Cognitive control and working memory.
- **Salience Network (SN)**: Detection and processing of salient events, as well as switching between the default mode and central executive networks.
