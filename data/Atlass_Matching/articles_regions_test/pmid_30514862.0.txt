Based on the neuroscientific article provided, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)**
   - Left superior frontal gyrus

2. **Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)**

3. **Striatum**
   - Ventral striatum

4. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex**

5. **Middle Frontal Gyrus**
   - Medial frontal gyrus

6. **Cerebellum**

7. **Cingulate Gyrus**

8. **Rolandic Operculum**
   - Bilateral Rolandic operculum

9. **Insula**
   - Bilateral insula

10. **Fusiform Gyri**
    - Bilateral fusiform gyri

11. **Precuneus**

12. **Parietal Regions**
    - Frontal, occipital, and parietal regions

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:

- **dlPFC**: Cognitive control, decision-making, working memory, and executive functions.
- **vmPFC**: Valuation, subjective value representation, and decision-making.
- **Striatum**: Reward processing, motivation, and reinforcement learning.
- **Posterior Cingulate Cortex**: Emotion regulation, memory retrieval, and self-referential processing.
- **Middle Frontal Gyrus**: Cognitive control, working memory, and attention.
- **Cerebellum**: Motor control, coordination, and cognitive functions.
- **Cingulate Gyrus**: Emotion regulation, error detection, and conflict monitoring.
- **Rolandic Operculum**: Gustatory processing and sensory integration.
- **Insula**: Interoceptive awareness, emotional processing, and sensory integration.
- **Fusiform Gyri**: Visual processing, face recognition, and object recognition.
- **Precuneus**: Episodic memory retrieval, self-processing, and consciousness.
- **Parietal Regions**: Spatial awareness, attention, and sensory integration.

These regions collectively contribute to the complex interplay of cognitive processes involved in value-based decision-making, impulsivity, and the neural mechanisms underlying obesity and related behaviors.
