Based on the neuroscientific article provided, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
     - Middle parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (CH01, CH02, CH03, CH04, CH05, CH08, CH13, CH14, CH18)
     - Brodmann's Areas (BA) 9 and BA 46
   - Frontopolar area
     - CH06, CH07, CH10, CH11, CH12, CH15, CH16
     - Brodmann's Area (BA) 10
   - Pars triangularis Brocaâ€™s area
     - CH 09
     - Brodmann's Area (BA) 45
   - Orbitofrontal area
     - CH 21, CH 22
     - Brodmann's Area (BA) 11

2. **Other Regions**
   - Central zero (Cz)
   - Nasion (Nz)
   - Right preauricular points (AR)
   - Left preauricular points (AL)

- These regions are involved in these cognitive functions: attention, working memory, decision-making, response execution, memory extraction, emotional assessment, socialization, perception, semantic judgment, and executive functions.
