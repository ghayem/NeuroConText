Based on the neuroscientific article provided, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are as follows:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Lateral portions

2. **Parietal Cortex**
   - Posterior portions
   - Superior parietal cortices
   - Inferior parietal cortices
   - Inferior parietal lobule (left)

3. **Occipital Cortex**
   - Areas of the occipital cortex
   - Calcarine fissure
   - Visual cortices in the occipital region

4. **Temporal Cortex**
   - Areas of the temporal cortex
   - Middle temporal gyri (left)
   - Inferior temporal gyri (left)

5. **Frontal Cortex**
   - Frontal cortices
   - Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices
   - Left inferior and middle frontal gyri
   - Right superior frontal gyrus
   - Left pre-supplementary motor area

6. **Cerebellar Cortex**
   - Right cerebellar cortices

7. **Frontoparietal Network**
   - Distributed frontoparietal network

These regions are involved in cognitive functions such as fluid intelligence (Gf), attention, executive functions, working memory, and abstract reasoning abilities.
