## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions

1. **Occipitotemporal Region**
   - Ventral visual cortex

2. **Lateral Temporal Area**
   - Associated with meaning

3. **Inferior Parietal Area**
   - Involved in phonological conversion

4. **Frontotemporal Junction Area**
   - Involved in pronunciation

5. **Sensorimotor Cortex**
   - Involved in semantic processing of nouns and verbs associated with body parts and their actions

6. **Limbic System**
   - Amygdala
   - Cingulate cortex

7. **Extrastriate Cortex**
   - Associated with emotion word processing

8. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**
   - Ventrolateral part
   - Orbital part

9. **Anterior Cingulate Gyrus (ACG)**

10. **Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC)**

11. **Occipitotemporal Cortex (OTC)**
   - Visual word-form area (VWFA)

12. **Basolateral Amygdala**

13. **Uncinate Fasciculus**

14. **Orbital Part of the IFG**

15. **Ventrolateral and Orbital Parts of the IFG**

16. **Pulvinar**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions including language processing, phonological activation, meaning comprehension, semantic processing, pronunciation, emotional processing, visual recognition, and affective word processing.
