Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Insula**
   - Specifically mentioned in the context of experiencing physical warmth and social warmth.

2. **Sensorimotor Cortices**
   - Primary somatosensory cortex (SI)
   - Secondary somatosensory cortex (SII)
   - Primary motor cortex
   - Premotor cortex

3. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus**
   - Mentioned in the context of brain responses while participants were giving their recommendations of sentences.

4. **Occipital Lobe**
   - Mentioned in the context of brain activations during the judgment phase without any priming.

5. **Posterior Parietal Lobe**
   - Mentioned in the context of brain activations during the judgment phase without any priming.

6. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Mentioned in the context of brain activations during the judgment phase without any priming.

7. **Inferior Parietal Cortex**
   - A part of the posterior parietal lobe.

8. **Bilateral insular-opercular cortex**
   - Mentioned in the context of the effects of cold sensations on neural activation.

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including sensory processing, motor control, and higher-order cognitive processes such as judgment and decision-making.
