Sure, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
    - Left ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC)
    - Right vlPFC
    - Left PFC
    - Right PFC

2. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**
    - Right IFG
    - Left IFG
    - Left orbital IFG (oIFG)
    - Right triangular IFG (tIFG)

3. **Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG)**
    - Right SFG
    - Left SFG

4. **Orbital Gyrus (OG)**
    - Right OG
    - Left OG
    - Lateral Orbital Gyrus (lOG)

5. **Cerebellum**
    - Left cerebellum

6. **Rostrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (rlPFC)**
    - Left rlPFC

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions including executive functions, inductive reasoning, domain-based and process-based cognitive processes, and hemispheric specialization.
