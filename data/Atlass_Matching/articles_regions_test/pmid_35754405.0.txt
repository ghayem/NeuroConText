Certainly! Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
    - Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)
    - Supramarginal Gyrus
    - Cuneus
    - Orbitofrontal Cortex

2. **Limbic Areas**
    - Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)
        - Subgenual ACC (sgACC)
        - Pregenual ACC (pgACC)
        - Supracallosal ACC (scACC)
    - Amygdala
    - Hippocampus

3. **Subcortical Areas**
    - Amygdala (including its connectivity with other subcortical areas)

4. **Other Specific Regions**
    - Fusiform Gyrus
    - Cerebellum
    - Precuneus
    - Posterior Cingulate Cortex
    - Middle Cingulate Cortex
    - Superior Temporal Region
    - Temporal and Superior Frontal Gyrus
    - Paracentral Lobule
    - Supramarginal Gyrus
    - Cuneus

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including emotion regulation, stress processing, and the development of psychopathology.
