Based on the article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Frontal Cortex**
   - Superior frontal cortex
   - Inferior frontal cortex
     - Left inferior frontal cortex
   - Premotor cortices
   - Prefrontal cortex
     - Right prefrontal cortex (rPFC)
       - Posterior region of middle and superior frontal gyrus
         - Brodmann's Areas 8 and 9 (BA8 and BA9)
       - Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; BA9)
       - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC)

2. **Temporal Cortex**
   - Right superior temporal sulcus region (rSTS)
   - Left temporo-parietal junction

3. **Parietal Cortex**
   - (Mentioned as part of the temporo-parietal junction)

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:

- Social cognition and interaction
- Decision-making
- Planning complex movements
- Prospective memory
- Theory of mind (ToM)
- Processing socially relevant information (e.g., body or facial movement)
- Goal-oriented social interaction
- Social decision-making
- Cooperative social behavior
