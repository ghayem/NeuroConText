## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions:

1. **Default-Mode Network (DMN)**
   - **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)**
   - **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)**
   - **Lateral Parietal Cortex (LatPar)**
   - **Hippocampal Formation (HF)**

2. **Task-Positive Network (TPN)**
   - **Frontal Eye Field (FEF)**
   - **Intraparietal Cortex (IPS)**
   - **Middle Temporal Area (MT+)**

3. **Right Fronto-Insular Cortex (RFIC)**

## Cognitive Functions:
- The DMN is involved in internally directed, self-reflective processes, such as introspection and self-referential thought.
- The TPN is involved in external attention-demanding tasks, elevated alertness, response preparation, and selection.
- The RFIC is critically involved in switching between the DMN and TPN.
