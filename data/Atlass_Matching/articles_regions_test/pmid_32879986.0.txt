Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Frontal Neural Systems**
   - Frontal lobe
   - Dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC)
   - Frontopolar area (BA10)
   - Pars opercularis (part of Broca’s area)
   - Pars triangularis (part of Broca’s area, BA45)
   - Pre- and supplementary motor cortex (BA6)

2. **Temporal and Parietal Regions**
   - Superior temporal gyrus (STG)
   - Angular gyrus (AG)
   - Supramarginal gyrus (SMG)
   - Wernicke’s area
   - Temporal parietal junction

3. **Other Regions**
   - Broca’s area
     - Pars opercularis
     - Pars triangularis
   - Amygdala
   - Sub-central area

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:

- **Frontal Neural Systems**: Decision making, cognitive control, speech production, and self-regulating behaviors.
- **Temporal and Parietal Regions**: Speech comprehension, social cognition, and emotional processing.
- **Other Regions**: Speech production (Broca's area), emotional processing (amygdala), and motor control (sub-central area).
