Sure, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Brainstem**
   - **Medulla**
     - Rostral ventrolateral medullar (RVLM)
     - Caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM)
     - Nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)
     - Dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve
     - Raphe nuclei

2. **Spinal Cord**

3. **Hypothalamus**

4. **Cortical Brain Regions**
   - Insular cortex
   - Cingular cortex
   - Supplementary motor cortex (in the region dedicated to the representation of the lower body)
   - Midcingulate cortex
   - Right anterior insular cortex

5. **Brainstem and Cerebellum**
   - Dorsal part of the medulla
   - Ventral part of the medulla
   - Midbrain
   - Pontine regions

These regions are involved in cardiovascular control, sympathetic tone regulation, and response to physiological manipulations that increase the sympathetic nervous system response.
