Based on the provided article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Thalamus**
   - Anterior nucleus
   - Ventral intermediate nucleus

2. **Cortex**
   - Auditory cortex
   - Motor cortex
   - Limbic cortex
   - Executive functioning cortex
   - Social cognition cortex
   - Temporal cortex
   - Sensorimotor cortex
   - Prefrontal cortex
   - Precentral gyrus ( left and right)
   - Postcentral gyrus ( left and right)
   - Superior parietal lobule (right)
   - Insulae (right)
   - Cuneus (right and left)

3. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   - Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)

4. **Central Executive Network (CEN)**
   - Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)

5. **Other sub-cortical regions**
   - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   - White matter (WM)

These regions are involved in various cognitive and sensorimotor functions, as well as neurobiological processes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
