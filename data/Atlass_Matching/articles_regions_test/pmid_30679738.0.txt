## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions:

1. **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)**

2. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**
   - Rostral ACC

3. **Precentral Gyrus**

4. **Middle Cingulate Cortex (MCC)**

5. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)**

6. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - ACC/mPFC region
   - PCC/precuneus region

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including social cognition, social emotion, self-reference, prosocial behavior, and functional connectivity related to social functioning and prosociality.
