Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Fusiform gyrus**
   - Left fusiform gyrus (LFG)

2. **Angular gyrus**
   - Left angular gyrus (LAG)

3. **Inferior frontal gyrus**
   - Right triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)

4. **Insula**
   - Right insula

5. **Cingulate gyrus**

6. **Default mode network (DMN)**

7. **Prefrontal cortex**
   - Right triangular inferior frontal gyrus

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:
- **Fusiform gyrus**: Visual processing, face perception, emotional perception processing, especially emotional expression recognition.
- **Angular gyrus**: Language and semantic processing, recognition and attention, episodic memory retrieval.
- **Inferior frontal gyrus**: Higher-order cognitive processes including attention, working memory, and executive function.
- **Insula**: Emotional processing, self-awareness, cognitive functioning.
- **Cingulate gyrus**: Emotion formation and processing, learning, memory, and executive functions.
- **Default mode network (DMN)**: Involved in self-referential processing, episodic memory retrieval, and mind-wandering.
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Executive functions, decision-making, moderating social behavior, and planning.
