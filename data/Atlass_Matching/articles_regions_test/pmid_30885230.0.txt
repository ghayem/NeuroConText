Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Amygdala**

2. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)**

3. **Hippocampus**
   - Bilateral hippocampus

4. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**

5. **Insula**

6. **Middle Cingulate Cortex**

7. **Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS)**

8. **Visual Number Form (VNF)**
   - Located in the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG)

9. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Includes DLPFC

10. **Paracentral Gyrus**
    - Bilateral paracentral gyrus

11. **Temporal Gyrus**
    - Left temporal gyrus

12. **Frontal Areas**
