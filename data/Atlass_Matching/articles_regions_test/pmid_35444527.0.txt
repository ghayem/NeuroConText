Sure, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Sensorimotor Cortex**
    - Bilateral sensorimotor cortex (S1 and M1)

2. **Non-sensorimotor Cortex**
    - Supplementary motor area (SMA)
    - Paracentral gyrus
    - Insular cortex
    - Anterior cingulate cortex
    - Middle frontal gyrus

3. **Motor and Sensory Tracts**
    - Corticospinal tract (CST)
    - Corticopontine tract

4. **Other Specific Regions**
    - Precentral gyrus
    - Postcentral gyrus
    - Paracentral lobule
    - Praecuneus

These regions are involved in various cognitive and motor functions, including sensory perception, motor control, and higher-order cognitive processes.
