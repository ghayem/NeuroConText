Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**
   - Pars triangularis

2. **Right Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)**

3. **Right Insula**

4. **Left Insula**

5. **Right Postcentral Gyrus**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:
- **Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**: Semantic rule retrieval, semantic working memory, and processing of deontic rules.
- **Right Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)**: Inference of others' intentions during moral judgment.
- **Right Insula**: Emotional processing, self-awareness, and cognitive functioning.
- **Left Insula**: Similar functions as the right insula, often involved in emotional and cognitive processes.
- **Right Postcentral Gyrus**: Sensory processing and motor functions.
