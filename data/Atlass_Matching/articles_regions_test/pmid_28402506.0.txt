Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Ventral Striatum**

2. **Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmpFC) / Medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (mOFC)**

3. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:

- **Ventral Striatum:** Reward processing, vicarious reward processing, and social valuation.
- **Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmpFC) / Medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (mOFC):** Value processing, prosocial decisions, and social outcomes.
- **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC):** Decision-making, tracking the negative value of decisions, and conflict monitoring.
