Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL)**
    - This region is involved in visuospatial function, sensory-motor processing, executive control, and salience detection.

2. **Transverse Temporal Gyrus**
    - This region is involved in auditory processing.

3. **Frontal Lobe**
    - This region is involved in executive functions, motor control, and higher cognitive functions.

4. **Entorhinal Cortex (ERC)**
    - This region is involved in memory and navigation.

5. **Temporal Lobe**
    - This region is involved in visual and auditory processing, as well as memory and language functions.

6. **Grey Matter (GM)**
    - This region is involved in various cognitive functions including memory, emotion, and sensory perception.

7. **White Matter (WM)**
    - This region is involved in communication between different regions of the brain.

8. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)**
    - This region is involved in the protection and support of the brain.

9. **Cerebral Cortex**
    - This region is involved in higher cognitive functions including perception, memory, and consciousness.

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions including memory, sensory processing, executive functions, and visuospatial functions.
