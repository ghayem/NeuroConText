Sure, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - Core brain area (not specified)

2. **Central Executive Network (CEN)**
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
   - Anterior cingulate cortex
   - Parietal lobe (parts of)

3. **Salience Network (SN)**

4. **Post DMN**

5. **Right CEN**

6. **Brain Networks**
   - Alpha-DMN
   - Beta-DMN
   - Alpha-CEN
   - Beta-CEN
   - Alpha-SN
   - Beta-SN

7. **Posterior Brain Area**

These regions are involved in various cognitive and emotional functions, including self-reference, self-reflection, emotional management, attention regulation, working memory, executive function, and emotional response.
