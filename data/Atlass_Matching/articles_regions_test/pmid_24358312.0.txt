Based on the neuroscientific article provided, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Cortex**
   - Frontal lobes
   - Temporal poles
   - Anterior parietal cortex
   - Posterior parietal lobes
   - Occipital lobes
   - Precentral gyrus
   - Postcentral gyrus
   - Superior frontal gyrus
   - Superior parietal gyrus
   - Medial orbitofrontal gyrus
   - Precuneus
   - Insula
   - Posterior cingulated cortex (PCC)
   - Dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)
   - Angular gyrus (AG)
   - Dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
   - Intraparietal lobular (IPL)
   - Frontal eye field (FEF)
   - Primary somatosensory cortex (SMC)
   - Primary visual cortex (VC)
   - Auditory cortex (AC)
   - Fusiform gyrus

2. **White Matter**

3. **Sub-cortical Structures**
   - Thalamus
   - Hypothalamus
   - Hippocampus
   - Parahippocampus

4. **Cerebellum**
   - Cerebellum-1
   - Cerebellum-2

5. **Other Regions**
   - Amygdala
   - Brainstem

These regions are involved in various cognitive, behavioral, developmental, and disease processes, as well as physiological and pathological states. The article also mentions several brain networks, including:

- Default mode network (DMN)
- Task-positive network (TPN)
  - Executive network
  - Salience network
  - Dorsal attention network
- Primary sensory networks (SN)
- Metabolic brain networks
- Covariance network
- Functional connectivity (FC) networks
- Large-scale brain covariance networks

The article discusses gender differences in these brain regions and networks, as well as their potential implications for understanding cognitive and behavioral differences between males and females.
