Sure, here is the list of brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)**

2. **Angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT R)**

3. **Helix 8 of AT R**

4. **Intracellular loop 2 of AT R**

5. **Extracellular loop 2 of AT R**

6. **Intracellular loop 3 of AT R**

7. **N-Terminus of AT R**

8. **Carboxyl-tail of AT R**

9. **DRY motif**

10. **PIF motif**

11. **NPxxY motif**

12. **Transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) of AT R**

13. **Transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) of AT R**

14. **Transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) of AT R**

These regions are involved in various physiological and pharmacological functions, including cardiovascular regulation, hypertension, and the binding of Angiotensin II and ARBs.
