Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the following brain regions and sub-regions are mentioned:

1. **Hippocampus**

2. **Medial Temporal Lobes (MTL)**
    - Hippocampus
    - Entorhinal cortex
    - Perirhinal cortex
    - Parahippocampal cortex

3. **Parahippocampal Gyrus (PHG)**
    - Right parahippocampal gyrus (specifically mentioned)

4. **Medial Frontal Cortex**

5. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex**
    - Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (specifically mentioned)

6. **Parietal Cortex**
    - Central-parietal regions
    - Parietal regions

7. **Neocortex**
    - Pyramidal cells in the neocortex

8. **Cerebral Cortex**
    - Cerebral amyloid deposition
    - Cerebral hypometabolism

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including memory, working memory, visuospatial working memory, and executive functions.
