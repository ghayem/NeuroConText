1. **Amygdala**
   - Involved in affective aspects of prejudice.

2. **Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)**
   - Associated with awareness of stereotypes and affective content of stereotypes about stigmatized groups.

3. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Lateral prefrontal cortex
   - Anterior cingulate cortex
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
   - Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)
   - Involved in cognitive control and regulating perceiversâ€™ automatic responses toward stigmatized individuals.

4. **Dorsal Striatum**
   - Right dorsal striatum
   - Associated with cognitive control.

5. **Superior Temporal Cortex**
   - Involved in cognitive functions such as language, memory, and executive functions.

These regions are involved in cognitive functions such as affective processing, stereotype awareness, cognitive control, and regulating automatic responses toward stigmatized individuals.
