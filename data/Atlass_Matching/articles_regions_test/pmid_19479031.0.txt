Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Frontotemporal regions**
   - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is mentioned, which implies involvement of frontal and temporal lobes.

2. **Motor cortex**
   - Upper motor neurons
   - Lower motor neurons

3. **Sensory nerves**
   - Although not a specific brain region, sensory nerves are mentioned in the context of neurological features.

4. **Spinal cord**
   - Although not a brain region, it is part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is mentioned in the context of ALS.

5. **Cortex**
   - The article mentions the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the cortex.

6. **Chromosomal regions**
   - Although not brain regions, specific chromosomal regions are mentioned that may contain genes relevant to ALS, such as:
     - Chromosome 1
     - Chromosome 13
     - Chromosome 15
     - Chromosome 16
     - Chromosome 17
     - Chromosome 22
     - Chromosome 4p15.2-p14
     - Chromosome 4q32.2-34.3
     - Chromosome 6p25.3-23
     - Chromosome 9p21.3-13.2

These regions are involved in the neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which affects motor neurons and leads to progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.
