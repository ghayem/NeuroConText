Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Posteromedial Cortices (PMCs)**
   - Posterior cingulate
   - Precuneus
   - Retrosplenial cortices
   - Inferior-posterior sector of the PMC (ipPMC)
   - Superiorâ€“anterior sector of the PMC

2. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex**
   - Dorsal region of the posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC)

3. **Frontal-Parietal Control Network**
   - (Note: This is a network rather than a specific region, but it is involved in executive attentional control.)

4. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - (Note: This is a network rather than a specific region, but it includes the ipPMC and is involved in abstract internally focused thoughts.)

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Abstract cognition
- Moral decision-making
- Introspection
- Visual attentional control
- Executive attentional control
- Sensorimotor and musculoskeletal processing
- Internally focused, value-oriented thinking
- Episodic memory and self-processing
