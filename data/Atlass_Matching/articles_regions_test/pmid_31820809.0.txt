Based on the neuroscientific article provided, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are as follows:

1. **Lateral Prefrontal Cortex**

2. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex**

3. **Medial Prefrontal Regions**

4. **Posterior Parietal Cortex**

5. **Basal Ganglia**

6. **Middle Cingulate Gyrus**

7. **Superior Frontal Gyri**

8. **Precentral Gyrus**

9. **Insular Cortex**

10. **Posterior Cingulate Gyrus**

11. **Temporal Lobe**

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:

- Executive functions
- Inhibitory control
- Attention and working memory
- Response inhibition and interference
- Cognitive control, behavioral flexibility, emotional regulation, and working memory
- Affective processes
- Sensorimotor and higher-order cognitive functions
- Language comprehension tasks
