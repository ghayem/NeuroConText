Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Cortical Regions**
   - Cortical neuronal activity
   - Subcortical neuronal activity
   - Subcortical sources
   - Cortical electrical neuronal activity
   - Temporal cortex (implied by EEG measurements)
   - Occipital cortex
     - Inferior occipital cortex
   - Parietal cortex
     - Right parietal regions
   - Cingulum

2. **Subcortical Regions**
   - Diencephalon
   - Brainstem

3. **Other Specific Regions**
   - Right occipital regions
   - Inferior occipital cortex
   - Broader posterior and caudal regions

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including attention, sensory processing, and motor control, as implied by the tasks and measurements described in the article.
