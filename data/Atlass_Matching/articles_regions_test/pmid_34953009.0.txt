Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Intraparietal Sulci (IPS)**
   - Left IPS
   - Right IPS

2. **Frontal Eye Fields (FEF)**
   - Left FEF
   - Right FEF

3. **Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ)**
   - Left TPJ
   - Right TPJ

4. **Ventral Frontal Cortex**

5. **Middle Frontal Gyrus**
   - Predominantly in the right hemisphere

6. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Inferior/middle frontal gyrus

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions and networks:

- **Dorsal Fronto-Parietal Attention Network:** IPS and FEF
- **Ventral Fronto-Parietal Attention Network:** Ventral frontal cortex and TPJ
- **Attentional Reorienting:** IPS, FEF, and TPJ
- **Visual-Spatial Attention:** Dorsal fronto-parietal attention network
- **Detecting Unattended Behaviorally Relevant Events:** TPJ
- **Covert and Overt Attentional Orienting:** FEF
- **Reorienting to Contralesional Targets:** TPJ and IPS

Additionally, the article mentions the following regions in the context of visual processing and attention:

- **Visual Areas** (not specifically named)
- **Empty boxes** (located to the left, right, top, and bottom of the fixation diamond, used as possible target locations in the spatial cueing paradigm)

The article also discusses the involvement of these regions in specific tasks and conditions, such as the Posner spatial cueing task and attentional reorienting along the horizontal and vertical meridians.
