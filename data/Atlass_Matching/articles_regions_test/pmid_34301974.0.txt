Based on the provided article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Cortices**
   - Primary motor cortex (M1)
   - Supplementary motor area (SMA)
   - Premotor cortex
   - Prefrontal cortex
   - Dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC)
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
   - Primary and premotor regions (bilateral)
   - Premotor and parietal regions (bilateral)
   - Superior frontal gyrus (right)
   - Superior parietal lobule (right)

2. **Subcortical Regions**
   - Cerebellum
   - Thalamus
   - Putamen

3. **Other Regions**
   - Cortical brain regions of the motor system
   - Motor network
   - Sensorimotor regions
   - Cortical and subcortical brain structures
   - Cortical regions
   - Subcortical regions
   - Bilateral premotor and parietal regions
