Based on the neuroscientific article provided, the following brain regions and sub-regions were mentioned:

1. **Frontal Lobe**

2. **Temporal Lobe**

3. **Parietal Lobe**

4. **Limbic Lobe**

5. **Cerebellum**
   - Posterior lobe
   - Anterior lobe

6. **Occipital Lobe**

7. **Sub-lobar Region**

8. **Cerebral Cortex** (general mention)

9. **Corpus Callosum** (mentioned in the context of fluid redistribution)

10. **Middle Cerebral Artery** (mentioned in the context of cerebral blood flow)

These regions are involved in various cognitive and physiological functions, including motor control, sensory processing, memory, emotion regulation, and coordination. The article discusses the impact of hypoxia and exercise on these brain regions, particularly in the context of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and cerebral edema.
