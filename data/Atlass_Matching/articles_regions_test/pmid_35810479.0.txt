Certainly! Below are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article:

1. **Prefrontal cortex (PFC)**

2. **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)**

3. **Insular cortex**

4. **Orbitofrontal cortex**

5. **Somatosensory cortex**

6. **Frontal lobe**
    - Precentral gyrus (Brodmann area 4)

7. **Parietal lobe**
    - Postcentral gyrus (Brodmann area 1, 3)

8. **Temporal lobe**
    - Middle temporal lobe (Brodmann area 39)

9. **Limbic lobe**
    - Parahippocampal gyrus (Brodmann area 28, 35)

10. **Insula**
    - Anterior insular cortex

These regions are involved in various cognitive and physiological functions, including expectation and anticipation of treatment outcomes, modulation of interoceptive signals, and regulation of stress and negative emotions.
