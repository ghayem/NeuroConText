Based on the neuroscientific article provided, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Cortical Midline Structures (CMS)**
    - Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)
    - Anterior Cingulate Cortex
    - Orbitofrontal Cortex
    - Posterior Cingulate Cortex
    - Thalamus
    - Left Angular Gyrus
    - Cerebellum
    - Right Superior Frontal Gyrus
    - Left Anterior Premotor Cortex
    - Right Primary Visual Cortex
    - Right Intraparietal Sulcus

2. **Other Brain Regions**
    - Thalamus
    - Left Angular Gyrus
    - Cerebellum
    - Right Superior Frontal Gyrus

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including self-referential processing, self-evaluation, affective processing, and mentalizing. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and adjacent regions of the anterior cingulate cortex are particularly highlighted for their strong associations with self-referential processes, including parenting self-evaluations.
