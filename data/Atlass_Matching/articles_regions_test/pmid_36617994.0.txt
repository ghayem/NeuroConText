### Brain Regions and Sub-regions:

1. **Frontal Lobe**
    - Dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex
    - Left and right anterior prefrontal cortex
    - Left superior frontal cortex (L SFC)
    - Left rostral middle frontal cortex (L rMFC)
    - Presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA)

2. **Parietal Lobe**
    - Left and right superior parietal cortex
    - Lateral and medial frontal and parietal lobes

3. **Temporal Lobe**
    - Auditory cortex
    - Right inferior frontal gyrus

4. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
    - Lateral and medial frontal and parietal lobes

5. **Dorsal Attention Network (DAN)**
    - Laterally across frontal and parietal lobes

6. **Executive Control Network (ECN)**
    - Laterally across frontal and parietal lobes

7. **Auditory Attention Network**
    - Regions involved in auditory attention and salience processing

8. **Salience Network**
    - Regions involved in salience processing

### Cognitive Functions:

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Attention to intention
- Goal-directed cognition
- Internally oriented cognition
- External environment monitoring
- Shifts in contextually relevant information
- Sustained cognitive control
- Action selection and execution
- Self-referential processes
- Context processing
- Auditory perception
- Understanding of linguistic instruction
- Short-term memory
- Attention to auditory stimuli
- Attention to intention to make a response
- Cognitive control over competing mental processes
- Execution of motor response

### Additional Notes:
- The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-SMA are particularly involved in higher-order attention and intention to move.
- The frontal and parietal aspects of the ECN are differentially involved in individual differences in response to anaesthesia.
- The DMN extends partially in lateral and medial frontal and parietal lobes and is involved in internally oriented cognition and external environment monitoring.
- The DAN and ECN are key to orchestrating stimulus-driven and goal-directed cognition.
- The auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus are involved in auditory perception and processing.
