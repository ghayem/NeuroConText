Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Frontoparietal network**
   - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
   - Lateral frontopolar cortex
   - Pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA)
   - Parietal cortex
   - Lateral occipital cortex

2. **Frontostriatal network**
   - Anterior caudate

3. **Default-mode network**
   - Medial orbitofrontal cortex
   - Precuneus
   - Temporal cortex

4. **Other regions**
   - Inferior parietal cortex
   - Anterior insular
   - Frontal operculum
   - Occipital cortex
   - Mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-DLPFC)

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including learning, working memory, attention, and executive functions, which are affected in people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
