1. **Left temporo-parietal areas**
   - Involved in phonological representation and the conversion between orthography and phonology.

2. **Left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)**
   - Involved in phonological segmentation and manipulation during phonological awareness tasks.

3. **Middle occipital gyrus (MOG)**
   - Involved in visual-perception tasks such as number identification, symbol detection, and arrow shape judgment.

6. **Left visual word form area**
   - Involved in visual word processing.

7. **Left precuneus**
   - Involved in visual–spatial processing and visuo-orthographic processing during Chinese visual word recognition.

8. **Right pre/postcentral gyrus**
   - Involved in language articulation and compensation for poor verbal memory.

9. **Left cingulate gyrus**
