## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions

1. **Angular Gyrus**
   - Right angular gyrus

2. **Middle Temporal Gyrus**
   - Left middle temporal gyrus

3. **Precuneus**
   - Right precuneus

4. **Sigmoid Sinus**
   - Sigmoid sinus wall

## Cognitive Functions and Associations

- **Angular Gyrus**: Involved in the integration of auditory stimuli, memory-related activities, self-awareness, and self-perception. It is also related to shifting attention in chronic tinnitus patients.
- **Middle Temporal Gyrus**: Part of the auditory association cortex, involved in auditory information processing.
- **Precuneus**: Involved in a variety of cognitive functions, including visuospatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, and self-processing operations.
- **Sigmoid Sinus**: Related to vascular somatosound and hemodynamics in the context of pulsatile tinnitus.
