1. **Visual Cortex**

2. **Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (VLPFC)**

3. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)**

4. **Anterior Temporal Lobe (ATL)**
    - This region is assumed to be a "hub" for integrating semantic information from multiple modalities.

5. **Left Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (VLPFC)**
    - This region is involved in contextual categorization and executive control of semantic concepts.

6. **Temporal Cortex**
    - This region is involved in semantic processing and neural adaptation.

7. **Left Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL)**

8. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)**
    - These regions are part of the default mode network and are involved in attentional processing.

These regions are involved in cognitive functions such as semantic processing, categorization, and executive control.
