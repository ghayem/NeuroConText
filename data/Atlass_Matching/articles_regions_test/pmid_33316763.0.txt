Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article, along with their associated cognitive functions:

1. **Limbic System**
   - Amygdala
   - Insula

2. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Orbitofrontal Cortex
     - Medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (mOFC)

3. **Temporal Cortex**
   - Superior Temporal Gyrus
   - Fusiform Gyrus

4. **Occipital Cortex**
   - Occipital Gyrus

5. **Parietal Cortex**
   - Postcentral Gyrus

6. **Cerebellum**

- These regions are involved in these cognitive functions: emotion processing, empathy, attention, salience detection, affective states, interoceptive awareness, facial expression recognition, and social cognition.
