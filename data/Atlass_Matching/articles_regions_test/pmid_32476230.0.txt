Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article, along with their associated functions where applicable:

1. **Caudate Nucleus**
   - Right dorsal caudate nucleus
   - Function: Involved in emotional, cognitive, and motor processing.

2. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**
   - Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   - Function: Involved in reward-based decision making, fear expression, behavioral adaptation, cognitive valuation, and control.

3. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
   - Dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   - Function: Involved in cognitive control, working memory, attention, goal maintenance, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and addiction.

4. **Parietal Lobe**
   - Right inferior parietal lobe
   - Left precuneus/superior parietal region
   - Superior parietal region
   - Inferior parietal region
   - Function: Involved in maintaining attentive control on current task goals, responding to salient new information, and flexible reconfiguration of behavior.

5. **Occipital Cortex**
   - Left occipital cortex
   - Right occipital cortex
   - Left inferior occipital cortex
   - Right inferior occipital cortex
   - Left inferior occipital-temporal region
   - Right calcarine cortex
   - Function: Involved in visual processing and perception.

6. **Temporal Cortex**
   - Left cuneus
   - Function: Involved in visual processing.

7. **Insula**
   - Right dorsal insular gyrus
   - Left insular gyrus
   - Function: Involved in emotional processing, self-awareness, and cognitive functioning.

8. **Thalamus**
   - Right premotor thalamus
   - Function: Involved in motor control, sensory processing, and consciousness.

9. **Postcentral Gyrus**
   - Left postcentral gyrus
   - Function: Involved in somatosensory processing.

10. **Precentral Gyrus**
    - Right precentral gyrus area 4
    - Function: Involved in motor control.

11. **Cingulate Gyrus**
    - Caudodorsal area 24
    - Right cingulate gyrus (caudal area 23)
    - Function: Involved in emotion regulation, pain processing, and cognitive control.

12. **Amygdala**
    - Function: Involved in emotional processing, decision-making, and memory.

These regions are involved in various cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor functions, as described in the article.
