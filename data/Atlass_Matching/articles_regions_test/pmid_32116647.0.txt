Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the following brain regions and sub-regions are mentioned:

1. **Frontal Region**
   - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   - Medial frontal gyrus
   - Left inferior orbitofrontal gyrus
   - Gyrus rectus
   - Bilateral anterior insula
   - Inferior frontal gyrus
   - Inferior frontal junction area
   - Superior temporal gyrus

2. **Temporolimbic Region**
   - Bilateral anterior insula
   - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)

3. **Motor Cortices**
   - Bilateral motor cortex
   - Right motor cortex

4. **Subcortical Regions**
   - Bilateral caudate
   - Putamen
   - Thalamus
   - Right thalamus

5. **Other Regions**
   - Frontomedial/ACC-caudate circuit
   - Frontolimbic structures
   - Medial prefrontal cortex
   - Caudate head
   - Medial frontal gyrus
   - Cognitive networks
   - Frontomedial/ACC and striatal regions
   - Motor system
   - Anteromedial portions of the temporal lobe
   - Sensorimotor cortex
   - Visual cortex

These regions are involved in various cognitive and motor functions, including:
- Emotional and cognitive processes
- Perception/interception and inhibition functions
- Motor execution
- Attention
- Language-related processing
- Emotion
- Cognitive function
- Emotion
- Inhibition
- Somatosensory processing
- Executive function
- Social cognition
- Motor execution
- Gray matter atrophy in motor regions
- Upper motor neuron involvement
- Pathological propagation of “prion-like” protein
- Transmission of TDP-43 pathology along axonal pathways
- Stereotyped progression of the ALS-FTD spectrum

This list includes all the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article, along with their associated cognitive and motor functions.
