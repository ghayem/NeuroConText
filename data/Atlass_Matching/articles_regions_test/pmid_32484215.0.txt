## Brain Regions and Sub-regions

1. **Striatum**
   - Ventromedial striatum
   - Dorsolateral striatum

2. **Prefrontal Cortex**
   - Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)

3. **Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc)**

4. **Midbrain**

5. **Frontostriatal Pathways**

6. **Inferior Frontal Fasciculus**

7. **Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus**

## Cognitive Functions

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Reward learning
- Value-based decision-making
- Motivational aspects of behavior
- Converting cognitive and motivational signals into motor programs
- Flexibly updating actions based on value-related changes in the environment
- Dopaminergic modulation
- White-matter integrity

## Additional Notes

- **Dopaminergic Projections**: Modulated by projections from the midbrain.
- **White-Matter Tracts**: Include frontostriatal pathways, inferior frontal fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus.
- **Neuroanatomical Evidence**: Suggests that reward learning necessary for optimal value-based decision-making in changeable environments recruits corticostriatal loops.

These brain regions and their functions are crucial for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making and reward processing, particularly in the context of aging and cognitive decline.
