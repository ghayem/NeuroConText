Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Frontal Lobes**

2. **Temporal Structures**
   - Superior temporal gyrus
   - Middle temporal gyrus

3. **Parietal Structures**
   - Post-central gyrus
   - Supramarginal gyrus

4. **Occipital Lobe**
   - Lingual gyrus

5. **Subcortical Structures**
   - Thalamus
   - Caudate nucleus

6. **Other Cortical Regions**
   - Anterior cingulate cortex
   - Insula

7. **White Matter**
   - Cerebral spinal fluid

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including but not limited to:
- **Frontal Lobes**: Executive functions, attentional and memory difficulties, cognitive flexibility and control.
- **Temporal Structures**: Language processing, memory, face recognition, and access to word meaning.
- **Parietal Structures**: Somatosensory processing, language perception and processing, phonological word choices.
- **Occipital Lobe**: Visual processing and encoding visual memories.
- **Subcortical Structures**: Integration of neocortical inputs and outputs, executive functions such as memory, learning, inhibitory control.
- **Other Cortical Regions**: Emotion processing, cognitive control, and error detection.
- **White Matter**: Structural connectivity and information relay between different brain regions.
