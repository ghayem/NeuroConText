Certainly! Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the neuroscientific article:

1. **Orbitofrontal Cortex**
   - Medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)

2. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - (Note: DMN is a network rather than a specific region, but it is mentioned in the context of altered activity in OCD.)

3. **Premotor Cortex**

4. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**

5. **Subthalamic Nucleus**

6. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Premotor cortex
   - Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
   - Frontal operculum

7. **Motor Cortex**

8. **Cingulate Cortex**

9. **Caudate**

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including value and cue-outcome encoding (orbitofrontal cortex), inhibitory control (premotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, subthalamic nucleus), and motor output (motor cortex).
