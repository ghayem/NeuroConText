## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions

1. **Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)**
   - Involved in evaluation and expectancy of reward of stimuli.

2. **Nucleus Accumbens**
   - Involved in reward processing.

3. **Caudate**
   - Involved in reward processing.

4. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**
   - Associated with attention and motivation processes.

5. **Parahippocampus**
   - Implicated in connecting environmental cues to internal states.

6. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)**
   - Related to processing goal-directed behaviors.

7. **Amygdala**
   - Associated with initiating conditioned and unconditioned behavior.

8. **Cuneus**
   - Involved in processing visual memories associated with conditioned stimuli.

9. **Precuneus**
   - Involved in processing visual memories associated with conditioned stimuli.

10. **Middle Occipital Cortex**
    - Involved in visual processing.

11. **Temporal Cortex**
    - Involved in visual processing and motivation.

12. **Primary Auditory Cortex**
    - Involved in auditory processing.

13. **Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG)**
    - Involved in auditory processing and affective stimuli.

14. **Insular Cortex**
    - Involved in salience processing and affective stimuli.

15. **Middle Frontal Cortex**
    - Involved in cognitive and executive processes.

16. **Inferior Frontal Cortex**
    - Involved in cognitive and executive processes.

17. **Middle Temporal Gyrus**
    - Involved in cognitive and executive processes.

18. **Inferior Parietal Lobe (IPL)**
    - Involved in cognitive and executive processes.

19. **Putamen**
    - Involved in reward and motivation processing.

20. **Thalamus**
    - Involved in reward and motivation processing.

21. **Midbrain**
    - Involved in reward and motivation processing.

22. **Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)**
    - Involved in reward and motivation processing.

These regions are involved in cognitive functions such as visual processing, reward processing, motivation, attention, goal-directed behaviors, and executive functioning.
