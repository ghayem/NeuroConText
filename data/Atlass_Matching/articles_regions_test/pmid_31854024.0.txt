Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Parietal Lobe**
    - Parietal cortex
    - Intraparietal sulcus (IPS)
        - Left IPS
        - Right IPS
    - Superior parietal lobule (SPL)
    - Inferior parietal lobule (IPL)

2. **Frontal Lobe**
    - Frontal regions (involved in attention and change detection)

3. **Visual Cortex**
    - Visual cortex

These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Numerical processing and representation
- Symbolic number representation
- Magnitude representation
- Ordinal processing
- Visuo-spatial attention
- Response selection and motor control
- Change detection and attentional state modulation
