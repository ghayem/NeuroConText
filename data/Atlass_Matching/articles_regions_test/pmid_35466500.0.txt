Based on the neuroscientific article provided, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Multisensory and Sensorimotor Brain Systems**
   - Involved in bodily self-representation.

2. **Cortical Midline Structures**
   - Involved in conceptual self-representation.

3. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)**
   - Part of the human mirror-neuron system.
   - Involved in action recognition.

4. **Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC)**
   - Involved in processing abstract self-related information.

5. **Temporal Parietal Junction (TPJ)**
   - Involved in self-other distinction across cognitive processes.
   - Includes the angular gyrus.

6. **Frontal Cortices**
   - Involved in action recognition and part of the human mirror-neuron system.

7. **Superior Frontal Gyrus**
   - Involved in self-related processing.

8. **Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG)**
   - Involved in action observation and imitation.

9. **Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)**
   - Involved in action observation and imitation.

10. **Parietal Cortex**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

11. **Occipital Cortex**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

12. **Temporal Cortex**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

13. **Precentral Gyrus**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

14. **Posterior Middle Temporal Gyrus**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

15. **Superior Parietal Lobe**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

16. **Inferior Occipital Gyrus**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

17. **Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC)**
    - Includes the motion-sensitive human middle temporal (hMT) region and the extrastriate body area (EBA).

18. **Superior- and Intraparietal Lobe Regions (SPL/IPL)**
    - Involved in visual and tactile WM tasks.

19. **Premotor/Motor Cortices**
    - Involved in movement decoding.

20. **Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS)**
    - Involved in social perception and sensitive to biological motion and goal-directed actions.

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including self-representation, action recognition, working memory, and social perception.
