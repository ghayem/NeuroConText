### Cognitive Functions:
These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Sensation and control of autonomic nervous system processes
- Human awareness
- Self-recognition
- Time perception
- Perceptual decision-making
- Cognitive response selection
- Word and sentence selection during language-based tasks
- Motivation evaluation
- Outcome anticipation
- Reward value recognition
- Error encoding to influence attention allocation and motor preparation
- Oculomotor control for goal-directed behavior
- Goal-directed processes related to higher-order cognition
- Executive functions related to planning tasks
