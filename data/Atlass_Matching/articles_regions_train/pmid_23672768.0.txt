Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the following brain regions and sub-regions were mentioned:

1. **Parieto-occipital Areas**
   - Occipital visual areas (BA 18, BA 19)
   - Posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG; BA 37, BA 39)
   - Parietal areas (PPC; BA 40, BA 7)

2. **Motor Areas**
   - Dorsal premotor areas (PMd; BA 6)
   - Cortical motor areas (associated with beta oscillations)

3. **Other Mentioned Regions**
   - Inferior parietal lobule (ILP)
   - Primary motor cortex

These regions are involved in various cognitive and motor functions, including visuo-spatial attention, motor preparation, and action observation.
