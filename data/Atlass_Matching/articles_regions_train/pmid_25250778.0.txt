Here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned in the article:

1. **Prefrontal Cortex**

2. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)**
   - Rostral ACC
   - Dorsal ACC

3. **Posterior Cingulate Cortex**

4. **Orbitofrontal Regions**

5. **Posterior Parietal Cortex**

6. **Temporo-Parietal Junctions (TPJ)**
   - Right hemisphere
   - Left hemisphere

7. **Precuneus**

8. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**
   - Includes multiple brain regions typically characterized as the DMN

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including:
- Cognitive control
