## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions:

1. **Fusiform Face Area (FFA)**
   - Located in the middle fusiform gyrus

2. **Occipital Face Area (OFA)**
   - Located in the inferior occipital gyri

3. **Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA)**
   - Located in the parahippocampal gyrus

4. **Extrastriate Body Area (EBA)**
   - Located in the extrastriate cortex

5. **Visual Word Form Area (VWFA)**
   - Located in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex

6. **Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS)**

7. **Ventral Visual Pathway**
   - Includes regions involved in object selectivity

8. **Occipital-Temporal Cortex**
   - Includes the FFA, OFA, and pSTS

9. **Occipital Fusiform Cortex**
   - Includes the FFA

10. **Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS)**
    - Includes the pSTS

11. **Temporal Cortex**
    - Covers the whole brain and includes the FFA

12. **Amygdala**

13. **Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC)**

14. **Precuneus**

15. **Anterior Temporal Cortex**

These regions are involved in these cognitive functions: face recognition, object recognition, place recognition, body recognition, visual word processing, and social information processing.
