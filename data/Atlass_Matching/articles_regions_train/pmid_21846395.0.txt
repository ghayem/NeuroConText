## Brain Regions and Sub-Regions:

1. **Frontal Lobe**
    - Inferior frontal gyrus
    - Middle frontal gyrus
    - Frontal orbital cortex (OFC)
    - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
    - Paracingulate gyrus (PCG)
    - Medial cortical areas

2. **Cerebellum**
    - Posterior lobe of the right cerebellum

3. **Parietal Lobe**
    - Bilateral precuneus

4. **White Matter**
    - Cerebral white matter
    - Periventricular white matter
    - Subcortical white matter
    - Deep white matter sensory and motor tracts

5. **Grey Matter**
    - Sensorimotor regions
    - Frontal parietal regions

6. **Other Regions**
    - Insula (In)

### Cognitive Functions:
These regions are involved in the following cognitive functions:
- Executive functions (including selective attention, response inhibition, and cognitive control)
- Motor control (especially for lower extremity)
- Gait and balance
- Physiological falls risk

### Additional Notes:
- The article discusses the role of brain structure and function in physiological falls risk, particularly focusing on executive functions and their neural correlates.
- Neuroimaging studies mentioned in the article highlight the importance of cerebral white matter lesions and their distribution in affecting gait, balance, and motor control.
- The study uses fMRI to examine brain function during an executive-challenging cognitive task, identifying specific brain regions associated with falls risk.
