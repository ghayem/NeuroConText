Based on the provided article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Substantia Nigra**
   - Pars compacta (SNc)
   - Pars reticulata (SNr)

2. **Striatum**
   - Putamen
   - Caudate nucleus

3. **Thalamus**

4. **Cerebellum**
   - Cerebellar crus II

5. **Motor Cortical Areas**
   - Primary motor cortex (M1)
   - Premotor cortex (PMC)
   - Supplementary motor area (SMA)

6. **Parietal Cortex**

7. **Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex**

8. **Hippocampus**
   - Left hippocampus

9. **Insula**
   - Left insula

10. **Brainstem**

11. **Subthalamic Nucleus**

12. **Midbrain Areas**

These regions are involved in various cognitive and motor functions, including motor sequence learning, stimulus-response associations, memory, and executive functions. The article also discusses their involvement in the neural mechanisms underlying motor sequence learning deficits in Parkinson's disease.
