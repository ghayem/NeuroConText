Based on the provided article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Amygdala**

2. **Hippocampus**

3. **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**
    - Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
    - Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)

4. **Posterior Parietal Cortex**

5. **Default Mode Network (DMN)**

6. **Executive Control Network (ECN)**

7. **Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG)**

8. **Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)**

9. **Salience Network (SN)**

These regions are involved in various cognitive and emotional functions, including but not limited to:
- **Amygdala**: Emotion processing, detection of behaviorally salient environmental cues.
- **Hippocampus**: Memory encoding, associative learning.
- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**: Executive control processes, memory, cognitive control, emotion regulation, goal-concordant decision making.
- **Posterior Parietal Cortex**: Executive control processes, memory.
- **Default Mode Network (DMN)**: Internally guided cognitive processes such as self-directed thinking, episodic memory, social reasoning.
- **Executive Control Network (ECN)**: Executive functions such as cognitive control, emotion regulation.
- **Superior Frontal Gyrus (SFG)**: Part of the executive control network.
- **Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC)**: Part of the salience network, involved in cognitive control and emotional processing.
- **Salience Network (SN)**: Detecting and filtering salient stimuli, as well as recruiting relevant functional networks.
