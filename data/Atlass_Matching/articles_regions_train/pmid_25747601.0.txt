Based on the provided neuroscientific article, here are the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned:

1. **Superior Temporal Gyrus**
   - Involved in speech processing.

2. **Occipital Gyri**
   - Left and right occipital gyri.
   - Involved in spatial-visual attention.

3. **Motor Cortex**
   - Premotor cortex.
   - Parietal lobe.
   - Involved in motor functions and planning of movements.

4. **Inferior Frontal Gyrus**
   - Involved in language processing, specifically Broca's area.

5. **Anterior Cingulate**
   - Involved in error detection, conflict monitoring, and cognitive control.

6. **Intraparietal Sulcus**
   - Part of the fronto-parietal network.
   - Involved in visuospatial processing and attention.

7. **Fronto-Parietal Network**
   - Includes regions around the intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus.
   - Involved in executive functions and attention.

8. **Fusiform Gyrus**
   - Involved in high-level visual processing, including face and object recognition.

9. **Precentral Gyrus**
   - Primary motor cortex.
   - Involved in voluntary movement.

10. **Visual Cortex**
    - Occipital lobe.
    - Involved in visual processing.

11. **Auditory Cortex**
    - Temporal lobe.
    - Involved in auditory processing.

These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including language processing, visual and auditory processing, motor control, and executive functions.
