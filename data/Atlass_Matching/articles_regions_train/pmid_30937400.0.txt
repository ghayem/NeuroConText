Based on the provided neuroscientific article, the brain regions and sub-regions mentioned are:

1. **Primary/premotor motor cortex**
   - Extending several centimetres along the central sulcus

2. **Mouth motor cortex**
   - Tongue
   - Lips
   - Palate
   - Jaw

3. **Premotor cortex (PM)**
   - Red area in figures

4. **Primary somatosensory cortex (S1)**
   - Blue area in figures

5. **Broca’s area (BR)**
   - Brodmann’s area 44 and 45
   - Yellow area in figures

6. **Prefrontal cortex (PF)**

7. **Inferior parietal cortex (IPC)**

8. **Superior parietal cortex (SPC)**

9. **Parietal operculum (OP)**

10. **Central Sulcus (CS)**

11. **Lateral Sulcus (LS)**

These regions are involved in the control and execution of orofacial movements, including speech production, laughing, smiling, and lip-licking.
